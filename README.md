# FreeCodeCamp URL Shortener

This is the third API project on the freeCodeCamp APIs and Microservices Certification.

This app will shorten any URL that you pass as a parameter. It will return original + shortened urls in a JSON response. If you visit the shortened url, it will redirect you to the original.
